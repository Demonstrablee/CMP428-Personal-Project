Try and Fill up the highest value doubles before the dealer!

--- CARDS ---
    QUEEN - pull a random card from other player
    KING - swap card hands with other player
    JACK - Steal an opponents doubles 
    ACE (HEARTS/DIAMONDS) - Roll 2 dice 
    ACE (CLUB/SPADE) - Knock out a players doubles

-- GAMEPLAY --
    1. Draw a card to end you turn
    2. Play cards and do actions to mess with your opponents doubles and cards;

-- WIN --
   1. Have the highest roll of doubles AND have at least 1 card in you hand
   2. Make your opponent lose all their cards

-- LOSE --
    1. Lose all your cards
    2. You don't end the game with the highest score in doubles 

-- TIE --
    1. You and the dealer have no cards
    2. You and the dealer have the same double score

-- NOTE --
    Even if you end the game collected all your doubles having all 6 slots full 
    1. YOU MUST have a total score HIGHER than that of the dealer at the end of the game to win
        Ex. If you roll all ones 6 ones and the dealer has only one double 6's you still Lose
    2. RETAIN YOUR CARDS if your last play will make you lose your last card you will still lose 
        since at the end you have no cards, AKA your winning move cannot make your hand empty or
        you will lose
    3. It's possible to give a player and empty hand causing them to lose; kinda cheap way to win
        but it is possible, I came to realize this a little too late :)
